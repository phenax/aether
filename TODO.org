      - When arg of macro returns an s-expr containing a symbol as argument, it gets evaluated (in if)
      - Maybe prevent arg to macros from becoming unquoted?
  - [ ] Stack trace info first class value
  - [ ] Shortcircuiting for &&, ||
  - [ ] Cleanup your shitty spec
  - [ ] Optimize list stdlib
  - [ ] Parser: allow empty files
  - [ ] CLI arguments (passed to `aether run`)

* Later
  - [ ] Repl
  - [ ] Unwrap macro builtin
  - [ ] `%`, `even?`, `odd?`
  - [ ] Add `...` support for de-structuring macro
  - [ ] Type validation util
  - [ ] `(assoc obj ':name "value")`
  - [ ] Optional properties
  - [ ] require other modules
  - [ ] Optional arguments?
  - [ ] Optimize interpreter perfomance
